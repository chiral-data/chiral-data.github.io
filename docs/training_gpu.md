# GPU Parallel Programming By Examples - Introduction

## Schedule and Place
- 14:00 - 16:00, January 29th, 2022
- [Engineer Cafe - Hacker Space Fukuoka](https://engineercafe.jp/ja/) - [赤煉瓦文化館 - 福岡市中央区天神1丁目15番30号](https://goo.gl/maps/5qXgfFTVxNQgUw5y6)

## Slides
will be available online soon!

## Outline
- Brief History of GPU, Big Data and Machine Learning
- Essential Paradigm of GPU Parallel Programming
- GPU Hardware and Memory Access
- Example by Tutoring: Array Operation (Python)
- Example by Practice: Fingerprint-base Molecular Similarity Search (Python)
- (Optional) Setup of CUDA C Programming Environment
- (Optional) Implementation of the Examples in CUDA C

## Description
This is a tutoring plus practice event for parallel programming on GPU. It's entry-level for programmers with Python experiences. We will work under [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) environment, therefore no self-owned GPU hardware is required for participation.

Understanding C/C++ is better but not required. There will be optional activities of implementing the two examples above purely in CUDA C for participants who are willing to dive deeper. 

A brief introduction of how the tech stack evovles into the AI era will be a warm-up from the begining, followed by some essential concepts of GPU parallel programming that are quite different from single thread programming. The pratice session will be composed of two examples: a simple one of large-size array operation will be demonstrated step by step and a complex one of molecular similarity searching from cheminformatic applications will be implemented by participants with discussions and supports during the event.

We are looking forward to your participation and let's learn by coding!
